        The Road Not Taken
                            -Robert Lee Frost

    Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
    And sorry I could not travel both
    And be one traveller, long I stood
    And looked down one as far as I could to Where it bent in the undergrouth

    Then took the other, as just as fair,
    And having perhaps the better claim,
    Because it was grassy and wanted wear,
    Though as for that the passing there
    Had worn them really about the same,

    And both that morning eqully lay
    In leaves no step had trodden black.
    Oh, I kept the first for another day!
    Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
    I doubted if I should ever come back.

    I shall be telling this with a sign
    Somewher ages and ages hence;
    Two roads diverged in a wood, and I...
    I took the one less travelled by,
    And that has made all the diffence.
